# Smart Grid Stability Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the stability of a grid using machine learning techniques. The primary aim is to classify whether a grid is stable or unstable based on input features derived from the dataset.

## Files in the Repository
- `smartgridprediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code, analysis, and results for the project.
- `smart_grid_stability_augmented.csv` : Dataset used for this project
- `requirements.txt` : Is the pacakages that are used for the project

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing data, normalization, and feature engineering.
- **Model Training**: Implements various machine learning models for classification.
- **Evaluation**: Compares models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
